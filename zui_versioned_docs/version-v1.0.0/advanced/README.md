# Advanced Guides

While Zui enables many powerful workflows by simply clicking in the app, some
advanced functionality may require performing operations at the shell. Topics
described here include:

* [importing Parquet and ZST](Importing-Parquet-and-ZST.md) format data, and
* working with [remote Zed lakes](Remote-Zed-Lakes.md).
