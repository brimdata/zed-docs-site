# NOTE: This is a test to protect an example shown in the Zed language
# docs. If you need to make changes to the Zed below to make the tests pass
# again after a change, the docs likely need to be updated as well.

# The Zed being tested below is exactly as it appears in the top-level
# docs/language/README.md.
