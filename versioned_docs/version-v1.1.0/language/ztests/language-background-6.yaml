# ============================================================================
# NOTE: This is a test to protect an example shown in the Zed language
# docs. If you need to make changes to the Zed below to make the tests pass
# again after a change, the docs likely need to be updated as well.

# See https://github.com/brimdata/zed/pull/2901 for details
# ============================================================================

# The Zed being tested below has been modified from the way it appears in
# docs/language/README.md, as the "sort" is needed to produce deterministic
# test output from the aggregation.

zed: |
  count() by color | sort

input: |
  {"color":"brown","name":"kiwi","flavor":"sweet"}
  {"color":"red","name":"apple","flavor":"tart"}
  {"color":"brown","name":"coconut","flavor":"nutty"}

output: |
  {color:"red",count:1(uint64)}
  {color:"brown",count:2(uint64)}
