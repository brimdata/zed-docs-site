# Javascript

The [Zealot library](https://github.com/brimdata/brim/tree/main/packages/zealot)
provides support for the Zed data model from within
Javascript as well as methods for communicating with a Zed lake.

Because Javascript's native type system is limtied, Zealot provides
implementations for each of Zed's primitive types as well as
technique for interpreting and/or constructing arbitrary complex types.
